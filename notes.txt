model grid of cells.

place nodes near edges with buffer.
draw segment of each line.  
	not overlapping any other node.
	not overlapping proximity of other lines.
	line is long enough.
	line has enough perpendicular overlaps.
	
draw line with one corner between two nodes.
reroute and add corners until 
	not overlapping any other node.
	not overlapping proximity of other lines.
	line is long enough.
	line has enough perpendicular overlaps.

draw line.
	drop shadow filter.
	replace intersection with random custom shadow intersection.

10x10 sample.  draw these.
